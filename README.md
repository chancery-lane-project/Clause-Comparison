# Clause-Comparison

## Description of Content 

The **xml_parser.py file** takes a messy XML file of all TCLP's website content and outputs a folder of text files containing only clauses, glossary terms, and guides. **A warning:** this was created based on the website architecture in October 2024 and if it ever changes dramatically (i.e. the name of "glossary terms" is changed), it will also need to be updated. Content uploaded in the same way as it currently has been will be fine. This can be used to re-pull content in the event that TCLP wants to retrain the model based on updated data to their website. The user will have needed to downolad the XML file of all content and saved it to the folder where they intend to run this script.
