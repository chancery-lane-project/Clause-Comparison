[\\nExplain and insert reasons. If the contract is aligned in one aspect but not another, please explain.\\n]\\n* \\n\\n1.2 The [significant contract OR transaction] will help us achieve our net-zero strategy by enabling us to deliver on the\\u00a0interim industrial or mergers and acquisitions (M&A) goals that are consistent with our near- and medium-term emissions-reductions targets for the following reasons. [\\nExplain and insert reasons.\\n]\\n1.3 The [significant contract OR transaction] may hinder our achievement of our [decarbonisation OR net-zero] strategy and interim industrial, M&A and emissions-reductions targets.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n1.3.1 This is necessary because [\\ninsert rationale\\n].\\n1.3.2 This can be mitigated by [\\ninsert mitigation options\\n].\\n1.3.3 [These mitigation options do not involve the use of offsets, or include a limited use of highest-quality offsets that apply to residual emissions that cannot be mitigated after adoption of best-available technologies, so are aligned with international best practice on net-zero strategy.] [These mitigation options involve the use of offsets to mitigate all or a substantial proportion of the emissions without making use of best-available technologies, and as such are not aligned with international best practice on net-zero strategy.

These are distinct from standard ESG considerations and include:\\n4.1.1 Just transition - [\\ndescribe any positive or negative impacts on the Company\\u2019s contribution to a just transition for employees, supply chains and communities\\n];\\n4.1.2 Culture - [\\ndescribe any positive or negative impacts on the Company\\u2019s [decarbonisation OR net-zero] culture, employee engagement and satisfaction, recruitment and retention of talent, upskilling or re-skilling\\n]; and\\n4.1.3 Biodiversity and nature - [\\ndescribe any positive or negative impacts on biodiversity loss and ecosystem services\\n].\\n5. Corporate governance and regulatory compliance\\n5.1 For the purposes of section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, it is noted that the [significant contract OR transaction] may have implications for the following stakeholder groups: [\\ninsert details of stakeholder groups relevant in the context of this board paper (for example, investors, employees, customers, suppliers, community, environment), why they matter and the issues or concerns that they may have in relation to the significant contract or transaction. Cross-reference discussion on just transition at 4.1.1 above if relevant.\\n]\\n5.2 The following actions have been or will be taken to address such stakeholder concerns [and or] to generate value for such stakeholders [\\nadd details of relevant trade-offs or concessions adopted or parts of the significant contract or transaction that may be tailored to address stakeholder concerns.\\n]\\n5.3 Such actions will create opportunities for value creation and [are [fully OR partially] aligned with][have no impact on][will help us to achieve] our [decarbonisation OR net-zero] strategy OR interim emissions reductions targets OR Paris-aligned business strategy OR operational plan on climate change OR long-term sustainable success].

This\\u00a0could be generated on-site or off-site. It does \\nnot \\ninclude:\\u00a0\\nspecifically designed cut and fill operations; or\\nrock armour from quarries.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nRecycled aggregates mean aggregates that have gone through a recovery\\u00a0process (for example, concrete crushing for hardcore or screening to separate\\u00a0soil from rock). This could be generated on-site or off-site.\\nThe winning of material on-site (such as through borrow pits) for use in the construction stage should not be included in the figures reported.\\u00a0\\n1.6.2 \\nObjective 2 (wastes)\\nThis objective relates to the difference in the amount of wastes arising from the construction works under the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year that are sent to landfill compared to the total amount generated (measured by weight in tonnes) from the same.\\u00a0\\nThis should be expressed as a percentage excluding hazardous wastes as defined in [\\nrefer to a schedule to the contract where hazardous wastes are defined\\n]. The\\u00a0hazardous wastes should not be taken into account in the performance report.\\u00a0\\nFor the purpose of measuring Objective 2, the total amount of construction waste should include all wastes arising from a construction project including waste materials that are generated and reused on site. Excavation materials\\u00a0that are produced and reused on-site are not regarded as waste.\\u00a0\\nDisposal in a landfill means deposit of the wastes within a landfill cell (including\\u00a0use as a daily cover material). Use of the material for engineering works (for\\u00a0example, for a clay cap) or as final restoration soils would be reused rather than disposal.\\n1.6.3 \\nObjective 3 (reduction in water consumption)\\u00a0\\nThis objective relates to the use of water on site from water mains, bowsers and abstractions.\\u00a0\\nFor example, the reuse of water from concrete washouts and rainwater harvesting are not counted in the target as this is re-use and to be encouraged.\\u00a0\\nFor the purpose of measuring Objective 3, it excludes the use of water in products delivered to site (for example, precast concrete units) but includes any used for mixing concrete on site for example.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nWater consumption information must be gathered from meters for mains water\\u00a0and bowsers must be manually recorded in addition to any abstractions. The Carbon Calculator* must be used to record this information.\\u00a0\\n* \\n1.6.4 \\nObjective 4 (reduction in whole life carbon footprint)\\nThis objective relates to the difference between the whole life carbon footprint reported as part of the [RIBA Stage 3 or Stage 4] approval for the project compared to the carbon footprint reported via the Carbon Calculator at Task Completion. This should be expressed as a percentage.\\u00a0\\n1.6.5 \\nObjective 5 (optimisation of resource use)\\u00a0\\nThis objective relates to the difference in the monetary value of all materials used arising from the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year that are certified by the ethical stone register, or at \\u2018bronze\\u2019 or above by the Cradle to Cradle certification scheme, compared to the total amount of materials used (measured by cost in [\\u00a3]) from the same.

There are various voluntary template wording in the market (e.g. The Chancery Lane Project (\\nTCLP)\\n and TCLP\\u2019s \\nCasper\\u2019s Clause\\n (\\u200bSustainability-Linked Loans) available for use. However, most lenders and private practice law firms active in this space would have their own language for use based on prior transaction experience.\\u00a0\\nDrafting guidelines\\nSource and baseline of SPTs should be clearly set out. The mechanism for measuring improvement relative to the SPT should be clearly documented.\\u00a0\\nAre the SPTs specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound? Do they set an appropriate level of net zero ambition aligned with achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in particular pursuing efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, halving absolute emissions every decade and achieving net zero or net negative emissions by 2050 or sooner? Please see The Chancery Lane Project\\u2019s \\nNet Zero Checklist\\n, \\nNet Zero Explainer\\n and \\nNet Zero: What is it? Video\\n for further information.\\nWhere information is being relied on to measure the SPT, consider whether independent verification will be required.\\nThe benefits and consequences of failure to meet SPTs should be clearly defined. The most typical benefit is a margin step-down, and the most typical (if any) consequence for failure to meet a minimum standard is a pricing step-up. Typically, there is no Default / Event of Default arising for failure to meet the SPTs.\\nConsequences of breaching ancillary provisions (e.g. failure to provide information, inaccurate reporting) should also be clearly set out \\u2013 unlike failure to meet the SPTs, these could lead to Default / Event of Default.\\u00a0\\nFor longer-term loans, SPTs may not be able to be accurately set in advance, or external events or circumstances may require amendment to the SPTs. Include provisions that clearly define conditions under which SPT definitions or calibrations can be updated to ensure sustained alignment with business and sustainability commitments.\\nWhat would an example of an SPT look like?\\nSustainability is generally synonymous with ESG. There is no definitive list of sustainability / ESG issues, but the table below provides examples of ESG improvements against which SPT parameters can be defined for guidance purposes.\\u00a0\\nIdeally, the SPTs should align with existing sustainability targets of the Borrower, its net zero target and its interim targets to achieve its net zero target, including organisational emissions reduction targets, a year on year percentage reduction of the Borrower\\u2019s emissions (a minimum of 7% if intended to be consistent with the aim of halving emissions every decade) and the quality of offset credits purchased in neutralising and compensating for residual emissions. They may also include ESG-related governance, training and education of the workforce and climate policy engagement (e.g. lobbying and trade association memberships).

Flexible working policy: home working to support achievement of net zero target\\n11.1 We are committed to providing equality of opportunity in employment and to developing working practices and policies that support work-life balance. Our Flexible Working Policy gives you an opportunity to formally request a change to your working pattern.\\n11.2 Line managers are encouraged to facilitate requests unless they cannot be accommodated for business or operational reasons. Advice will be sought from the Sustainability Team in each instance to ensure the environmental benefits of each flexible working are given due consideration and an appropriate weighting.\\n11.3 In particular, we recognise that flexible working offers an opportunity for our business to reduce our Carbon Footprint that will contribute to achieving\\u00a0our Net Zero Target. Accordingly, we support home working in appropriate circumstances either occasionally (to respond to specific circumstances or to complete particular tasks) and in some cases on a regular (full or part-time) basis.\\n11.4 Homeworking can be authorised by your line manager (having sought advice from the Sustainability Team) where, in their opinion:\\n(a) you have work that can be done at home;\\n(b) working at home is cost-effective and any increase in work that may be passed to your colleagues as a result is kept to a minimum; and\\n(c) working from home (either occasionally or regularly, as applicable) will significantly reduce our Carbon Footprint and the emissions of GHG associated with your commute and/or have another positive environmental impact.\\n11.5 If you wish to apply to work from home, you will need to be able to show that you can:\\n(a) work independently, motivate yourself and use your own initiative;\\n(b) manage your workload effectively and complete work to set deadlines;\\n(c) identify and resolve any new pressures created by working at home;\\n(d) adapt to new working practices including maintaining contact with your line manager and colleagues at work; and\\n(e) significantly reduce our Carbon Footprint and the emissions of GHG associated with your commute and/or or have another positive environmental impact.\\n11.6 [When working at home, you are responsible for operating your virtual office in a sustainable manner (for example, buying 100 (one hundred) percent renewable energy and avoiding single-use office supplies).]\\n11.7 In support of this, we offer each employee an annual home working allowance up to the value of \\u00a3[\\n\\u25cf\\n]. Please contact the [HR Team] to claim your home working allowance. Purchases can be made from our approved suppliers only. You will be expected to provide copies of your receipts and will be reimbursed in the next payroll run following your purchase.\\n12. Holiday policy: additional holiday to encourage sustainable travel\\n12.1 To allow you to make a more sustainable choice when considering how to use your holiday entitlement:\\n(a) you may claim 1 (one) additional days holiday (to be added to the start or end of your trip) where you decide to travel to a [domestic] holiday destination for a holiday of more than 5 (five) working days without flying to that destination (for example, by choosing to travel by car, rail or ferry); and\\n(b) you may claim 2 (two) additional days\\u2019 holiday (to be added to the start or end of your trip) where you decide to travel to a [foreign] holiday destination for a holiday of more than 5 (five) working days without flying to that destination (for example, by choosing to travel by rail or ferry).\\n12.2 Claims for additional holiday must be approved by the [HR Team] at least 1 (one) month in advance of your holiday and you can only claim for additional holiday once in each holiday year.\\n13. Procurement policy: sustainable procurement, single-use plastics, waste and water conservation\\n13.1 Please see our [procurement policy] for details of our commitment to sustainable resourcing choices, including sourcing local, low carbon materials where possible, making sustainable food sourcing choices, requiring our suppliers to reduce their emissions of GHG, following circular economy principles and [\\ninsert details\\n] for our policy of minimising food waste and general waste. Please see [\\ninsert\\n] for our water conservation policy and [\\ninsert\\n] for our policy on promoting nature and biodiversity within our operations.\\n13.2 Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental pollution challenges facing the world today. In response to this, we expect you to try to eliminate the use of single-use plastics in our working environment and supply chain. Single-use plastics are disposable plastics, which are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled.\\n13.3 This policy seeks to identify where use of single-use plastics is prevalent and where more sustainable replacements can be chosen. Monitoring usage of single-use plastics will help us to implement a measurable reduction plan.\\n13.4 Together, we make a commitment to:\\n(a) work with each other ensure that the use of single-use plastics is eliminated from our working environment;\\n(b) work with our partners to ensure that single-use plastics are not used at any events that we hold or have a role in organising;\\n(c) work with each other, our partners and the local business community to develop innovative projects to eliminate the use of single-use plastics across the local business community; and\\n(d) share best practice and information about our single-use plastic elimination initiatives with each other, our partners and the local business community.\\n13.5 Where the use of plastics is unavoidable, we will encourage the use of recycled plastics, where practicable and wish to support manufacturers that make products from locally sourced waste plastics.\\n14. Training policy: environmental and sustainability training programmes\\n14.1 We are committed to developing the skills of our employees and recognise that training can benefit us, our staff and the environment. Staff will receive training appropriate to their role, subject to need, and to operational and budgetary considerations.\\n14.2 Training needs will be identified through regular performance reviews. You will be given appropriate access to training to enable you to progress within our business.\\n14.3 [We encourage employees to enrol onto OR Employees [must OR are expected to attend] our internal environmental and sustainability training programmes during their usual working hours (and online as required) [regularly OR quarterly OR annually]. These training programmes will cover details of our public and contractual commitments, targets and governance in relation to climate change and sustainability, the latest climate science, climate change policy and relevant legal context, the economic, social and health benefits in reducing the workplace\\u2019s environmental impact, education regarding sustainable eating habits, lifestyle changes and how to access support to achieve them, promotion of the protection and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystems, the importance of achieving a zero-carbon working environment and other topical climate and sustainability issues.\\n14.4 You may also seek approval from the Sustainability Team to enrol onto external environmental and sustainability training programmes [where you have a justifiable business need for additional knowledge]. Please discuss any ideas you may have with the Sustainability Team.\\n14.5 External environmental and sustainability training programmes do not need to lead to a formal qualification. The only limitation is that their purpose must be to enable you to improve the environmental performance of our business and/or better contribute towards the achievement of our Net Zero Target.\\n15. Whistleblowing policy: environmental whistleblowing\\n15.1 Whistleblowing is the disclosure of information which relates to suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work. This may include:\\n(a) failure to comply with any legal or professional obligation or regulatory requirements (including environmental law);\\n(b) conduct that detrimentally impacts our ability to achieve our Net Zero Target;\\n(c) conduct which causes damage to the climate or the environment (which is not part of a reasonable working life);\\n(d) conduct likely to damage our reputation as an environmentally conscious business; or\\n(e) the deliberate concealment of any of the above matters.\\n16.

Where a taxi journey is necessary, employees should pool or share cars, wherever possible.\\n6. Electronic Communications & Data Storage\\nThe Parties recognise the carbon footprint of electronic communications (such as the energy used for data storage by data centres). Therefore, to minimise such carbon footprint, the Parties agree to the extent reasonably practicable to:\\n(a) check draft emails before sending them to ensure they contain the necessary and correct information to avoid the need for follow-up emails;\\n(b) avoid replying to all (replies should be required and sent only to the original sender rather than to all distribution lists of the Parties);\\n(c) send attachments only where necessary and in PDF rather than Powerpoint or other format; and\\u00a0\\n(d) regularly clean and maintain mailing lists.\\n7. Deal memorabilia\\n7.1 The Parties agree to avoid producing and distributing deal memorabilia (toys, tombstones, etc.), and will, as an alternative way of commemorating a completed deal, consider making donations to charities or initiatives that actively mitigate climate change and/ or promote biodiversity (such as planting a tree). Where for relevant cultural reasons some form of memorabilia is deemed necessary, any products commissioned will only be produced from recycled or sustainably sourced materials, and distribution methods will be managed in an environmentally conscious manner.\\n[7.2.

Whistleblowing regime for Climate-Related Issues\\n1.1 To show our commitment to these objectives and policy [we have established a whistleblowing regime][we will incorporate Climate\\u2013Related Issues into our existing whistleblowing regime] for [employees, workers, volunteers, interns[,][and] business partners [and suppliers]*].\\n* \\n\\n1.2 This regime will provide a contact for the whistleblower, who can make reports anonymously if they wish to do so.* [The whistleblower may seek advice and support from the company\\u2019s whistle-blowing champion [who will maintain the anonymity of the whistleblower unless the whistleblower requests otherwise]].\\n* \\n\\n1.3 Following receipt of the information by the contact, an internal assessment and investigation will be conducted by [\\nappropriate individual(s) identified in accordance with the \\u2018Reporting channels\\u2019 guidelines below\\n].\\n\\n1.4 If the conclusion of the investigation is that there is credit to the report it will be reported to the board of the company.\\u00a0\\n[1.5 Regardless of whether the report is found to be creditable and conveyed to the board of the company pursuant to clause 1.4, the contact shall:\\n(a) notify the whistleblower promptly of the conclusion of the internal assessment and investigation; and\\n(b) [where the company deems reasonable] respond promptly and in reasonable detail to any enquiries the whistleblower may have about the internal assessment and investigation, provided such enquiries are not malicious, abusive or frivolous [and are made within [10 business days] of its conclusion].] \\n1.6 Unless a report is malicious, abusive or frivolous, the making of a report will result in no retaliation and will have no negative effect on the whistleblower's career.\\nGuidelines and considerations for implementing the whistleblowing regime\\nReporting channels: \\n\\nSpecify the reporting modes available to whistleblowers and consider how to provide the option of anonymous reporting and/ or a whistleblowing champion. It may be that this is included in the company\\u2019s current whistleblowing policy with a warning that although the company will encourage such reports, they may not fall within protection afforded by the local legislation on whistleblowing.\\nDetermine the most suitable person(s) (who will be given training) for the receipt and treatment of internal reports. In larger companies, this would likely be the audit committee or a steering committee, with such committees then reporting regularly to the board. Alternatives could be, for example,\\u00a0compliance officers, legal counsel, or such processing can be outsourced. The reporting channels should be clearly and regularly communicated to all staff and business partners.\\nAcknowledging reports and providing updates:\\n\\u00a0The EU Whistleblowing Directive requires that whistleblowers be informed of the receipt of their report within seven days and of any action taken (including the status outcome of the internal investigation) within three months. Companies are not bound by the Directive and it should be considered whether to reduce the time frame for initial acknowledgement (for example, to 1-2 business days), or for providing reports on the status of the outcome. Specify these timeframes in the whistleblowing policy and procedure. It is worth noting that, depending on the outcome of the investigation, it may not be appropriate to provide details on the outcome of the investigation other than to note that the whistleblower\\u2019s concerns were found to have grounding and that action was being taken. \\nTraining: \\nTraining workers regularly on how the whistleblowing regime works and its process and features is crucial. Workers need to know that the whistleblowing regime is an option available to them and that they are encouraged to use it, if appropriate. Training can be part of all employee on-boarding, and also be provided to business partners, with regular communications to remind the relevant stakeholders of the policy.\\nIdentifying reportable breaches: \\nConsider what situations would breach the company\\u2019s stated net zero policy and provide tangible examples in stakeholder training, such that they may be able to identify a similar reportable situation if it occurs. If for example the company has a commitment to working with suppliers with certain green credentials as part of its net zero policy, and a stakeholder becomes aware that the company is working with a supplier that does not in fact meet these credentials that could form the basis of a report. Consider using real-life scenarios in training (anonymised), to make the examples more accessible.\\n[\\nWhistleblower reward: \\nconsider whether you would like to incentivise employee/ stakeholder buy-in through a reward, appropriate to the size and nature of your business. This could be a small financial reward, a voucher or a non-financial reward such as, for example, the opportunity to attend external training or something of value to the relevant stakeholder. This should be considered in light of any incentives given with regard to any other whistleblowing policy.] \\nTransparency\\n: The net zero whistleblowing reports received and actions taken in response to any whistleblower\\u2019s information investigated and reported should be reported regularly to the Board, and made available to other stakeholders (consider also making publicly available). What constitutes \\\"regular\\\" will differ on a case by case basis, but will likely be no less than annually. Whistleblower anonymity must be preserved.\\nRegime statistics: \\nConsider collecting statistics on the number of net zero whistleblowing reports made and using those statistics to measure the effectiveness of the policy's implementation (consider also making them publicly available). A small number of reports can indicate that there are no (or very few) breaches. However, receiving no reports at all may also indicate that potential whistleblowers do not know the policy exists or do not feel comfortable using it.\\nSafe storage of reports:\\n\\u00a0Reports must be safely and confidentially stored, such as by using an information barrier. \",\n",
