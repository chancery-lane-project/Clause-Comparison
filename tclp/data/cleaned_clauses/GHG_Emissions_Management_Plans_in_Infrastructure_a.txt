*[Align terminology and remedies available with the main contract and ensure that the remedy is appropriate.

Drafting notes:The consequences of a GHG Emissions Breach Event of Default will be determined on a project by project basis.

The consequences will depend on the nature of the breach.

If the breach is significant and not capable of remedy, there may need to be a dismantling and then re-design of the project to ensure that the project does meet the emissions standards.

Consider including(in addition)an indemnity from the Contractor to the Project Company in respect of losses arising from such a breach.

Given the potentially high costs the Contractor may not agree to an indemnity unless there was a cap on liability..
