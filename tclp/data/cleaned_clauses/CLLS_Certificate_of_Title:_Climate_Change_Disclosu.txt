1. Physical Risks:Climate Change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of weather events with the potential to damage property such as flooding, high winds, storms and greater temperature extremes.

2. Transition Risks:The UK Government's current policy is to reduce the volumes of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.

It is targeting net zero emissions by 2050 with interim targets to be achieved prior to that date.

Legislation is already in place to support this policy but we understand that this is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve those targets.

We therefore anticipate the possibility of legal changes to require owners and occupiers to make appropriate investments and improvements to the construction and use of buildings.[OPTION 2:]We have not undertaken searches or raised specific enquiries to clarify the risks to the Property from Climate Change.
