1. Strategy implications Alignment 1.1 The proposal to enter into the[significant contract OR transaction]is[fully OR partially OR not]aligned to our agreed[decarbonisation OR net-zero]target*, interim emissions-reductions targets, Paris-aligned business strategy and operational plan on climate change, and in particular the delivery of near- and medium-term milestones that are a prerequisite to reaching the longer-term[decarbonisation OR net-zero]target, for the following reasons.[Explain and insert reasons.

If the contract is aligned in one aspect but not another, please explain.]* 1.2 The[significant contract OR transaction]will help us achieve our net-zero strategy by enabling us to deliver on the interim industrial or mergers and acquisitions(M&A)goals that are consistent with our near- and medium-term emissions-reductions targets for the following reasons.[Explain and insert reasons.]1.3 The[significant contract OR transaction]may hinder our achievement of our[decarbonisation OR net-zero]strategy and interim industrial, M&A and emissions-reductions targets.

1.3.1 This is necessary because[insert rationale].

1.3.2 This can be mitigated by[insert mitigation options].

1.3.3[These mitigation options do not involve the use of offsets, or include a limited use of highest-quality offsets that apply to residual emissions that cannot be mitigated after adoption of best-available technologies, so are aligned with international best practice on net-zero strategy.][These mitigation options involve the use of offsets to mitigate all or a substantial proportion of the emissions without making use of best-available technologies, and as such are not aligned with international best practice on net-zero strategy.

They are subject to the following risks[insert reputational risks from offsets and commercial risks should assumptions on cost and the continued availability of offsets differ materially from actual outcomes.]]1.4[Our Scope 3 emissions targets[have OR have not]been cascaded to the counterparty as part of[the significant contract OR transaction], and therefore[do OR do not]bring us closer to meeting our near-[and/ or]medium-term Scope 3 emissions targets.[See Owen’s clause(net zero target supply chain cascade).]1.5 Once signed we[will OR will not]be able to terminate the[significant contract OR transaction]to move to an alternate, lower-carbon counterparty.[See Agatha’s clause(termination for greener supplier)or Annie’s clause(green termination(short form)).]1.6 The following due diligence has been undertaken on the counterparty to ensure they are aligned with our[decarbonisation OR net-zero]targets and corporate climate strategy:1.6.1[Our[decarbonisation OR net-zero]and interim targets are aligned]; 1.6.2 The counterparty’s SECR carbon intensity ratio has reduced in the last[number]years; 1.6.3 The counterparty’s decarbonisation strategy focuses primarily on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, with limited recourse to high-quality offsets for residual emissions, rather than large-scale offsetting as a substitute for mitigation; and 1.6.4 The[climate OR sustainability]team has reviewed their[transition OR decarbonisation]plan and concluded it is[credible OR not credible OR needs work].

Emissions 1.7[Our best estimate of the emissions arising from the[significant contract OR transaction]are:[]Scope 1:[number]; []Scope 2:[number]; and[]Scope 3:[number].]OR[It is not possible to estimate the emissions arising from the[significant contract OR transaction]because[insert reason].].

1.8 This means our carbon footprint will[increase OR decrease]by[number]tn.

CO2.eqv.(as appropriate), expressed as a carbon dioxide equivalent(CO2e).]1.9 The[significant contract OR transaction]is estimated to[delay OR accelerate]the achievement of our net-zero target or interim target by[number]years.

This will be announced to shareholders[and or]markets.

Measurement and progress 1.9.1 The[significant contract OR transaction]contains contractual rights to information to support the measurement and progress towards our[decarbonisation OR net-zero]target, interim emissions-reductions targets, Paris-aligned business strategy and operational plan on climate change.[Explain].

Commercial opportunities 1.9.2 The climate considerations and net-zero reduction created by the[significant contract OR transaction]contains the following commercial opportunities for the Company.[Explain.

For example, is there an opportunity to share value if management believes a transaction will bring forward the achievement of a decarbonisation target, a net-zero target or an interim target?].

2. Financial implications 2.1 The[significant contract OR transaction]involves or will result in capital or operational expenditure that is[fully OR partially OR not]aligned with our agreed[decarbonisation OR net-zero]target, interim emissions-reductions targets, Paris-aligned business strategy and operational plan on climate change.[Explain.]2.2 The climate risks and issues underlying the[significant contract OR transaction]have been identified and[are OR are not]likely to require specific mention in the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation(IFRS)aligned disclosures or financial statements in accordance with IFRS Educational Materials on the Effects of Climate-related Matters .
