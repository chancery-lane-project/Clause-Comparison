Schedule 1:Sustainable Performance Target[this Schedule]further details of the ERMs to be achieved.]In order to meet the GHG Reduction Targets, the Borrower shall select at least[two]of the Emissions Reduction Measures as set out at paragraph 1.1 below, provided that if the Borrower wishes to select ERM6 they must have selected at least[two]other Emissions Reduction Measures to be achieved in priority to ERM6. 1. Emissions Reduction Measures 1.1. The Borrower shall implement the following ERMs in accordance with Clause 4.2 and this Schedule[]of the Agreement.

ERM Category Targets ERM1 Energy efficiency[Improvements in the energy efficiency rating of buildings, use of fuel and/ or machinery owned or leased by the Borrower.][e.g. before end of March 2022][Reduction of[AMOUNT %]in energy wastage through inefficiencies in cement production or the manufacturing cycle on or before[DATE]]ERM2 Products greenhouse gas emissions[Reductions in Greenhouse Gas emissions by[X%]in relation to cement manufactured or sold by the Borrower(through the use of alternative fuels)or to the production or manufacturing cycle on or before[DATE]including by the means specified in the Technical annex to the TEG final report on the EU Taxonomy Regulation .]ERM3 Renewable energy[Increases in the amount of renewable energy generated or used(for example, entering into Virtual Power Purchase Agreements to source renewable energy)by the Borrower by[AMOUNT]on or before[DATE].]ERM4 Direct installation and use of on-site green energy[Investment in and installation of on-site green energy facilities to be used by the Borrower on or before[DATE].]ERM5 Investment in green technology[Investment in and/ or the installation of green technology(such as Carbon Capture and Storage)to assist with the production and manufacturing of cement on or before[DATE].]ERM6 Offsetting/ Insetting Emissions[Investment of[AMOUNT]in external projects and/ or projects within the Borrower’s own supply chain and supply chain communities which will offset the Borrower's carbon emissions on or before[DATE]](such as carbon capture and novel cements which act as a vehicle for carbon storage).

Any external offsetting should be done through a project that has been verified in accordance with[insert name of voluntary standard*]or from a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC)clean development mechanism(CDM)[or[successor/ equivalent]UNFCCC mechanism]project.

*[This might include for example Gold Standard; Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards; Carbon Neutral Protocol or Verified Carbon Standard .

When selecting a standard, the parties should give consideration to the extent to which the offsets can be achieved through removals rather than reductions of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, be transparently and correctly accounted for, with a low risk of non-additionality, reversal, and creating negative unintended consequences for people and the environment, in accordance the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting .]References:Loan Market Association, Green Loan Principles:Guidance(May 2020).
