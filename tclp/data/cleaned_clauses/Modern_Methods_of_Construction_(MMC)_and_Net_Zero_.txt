3.5 If the Carbon Budget of the Works(excluding Changes* issued in accordance with clause[●])is exceeded due to a breach by the Contractor[(or any of its subcontractors or suppliers)**]of its obligations under this clause[3], then liquidated damages at the rate of[£[●]]per tonne of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent of GHGs over and above the Carbon Budget shall be due and payable from the Contractor to the Employer.
