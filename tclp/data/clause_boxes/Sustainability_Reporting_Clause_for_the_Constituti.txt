	<h4>Sustainability Reporting Clause for the Constitution of a Private Limited Company</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">This clause is a set of draft clauses for a private limited company’s constitution. Ensures that sustainability performance is being regularly reported on, evaluated, and discussed by the board.  In the changing landscape around sustainability reporting and sustainability due diligence, it is increasingly important for companies not only to ensure that they have corporate sustainability policies in place - but that these policies are being regularly discussed at board level and updated as necessary.</p>
