Child's Name: Jess and Rory's Clause
Long Name: Gain-Share Incentive for Reducing GHG Emissions
Excerpt: This clause incentivises a counterparty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in exchange for a gain-share payment calculated by reference to the value of the goods or services it provides. This clause introduces a gain-share payment into a contract. Receiving a gain-share payment in exchange for reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the contract term is a powerful incentive for a party to decarbonise â€“ especially in sectors that operate on narrow margins (like construction) or commercial environments undergoing aggressive cost savings.
