	<h4>Climate-Resilient Landscape Design Contracts</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">Insert a clause into landscape architect appointments and/ or building contracts requiring the appointee to utilise the available open space in an environmentally efficient manner. This clause promotes nature based solutions and biodiversity in landscape architect appointments and/ or building contracts, on land that might otherwise be used in a carbon intensive or unsustainable way. To be fully effective, the use of this drafting should be aligned with the development of laws/ planning regulations around habitat ‘zoning’ to encourage habitat continuity and species corridors across the landscape.</p>
