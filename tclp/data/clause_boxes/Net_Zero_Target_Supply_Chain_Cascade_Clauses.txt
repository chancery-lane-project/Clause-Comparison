Long Name: Net Zero Target Supply Chain Cascade Clauses
Excerpt: Aligns a business’ carbon reduction target with its supply chain and business partners, enabling the business to achieve its target or take control to achieve it. This clause supports parties to achieve decarbonisation by setting emissions reductions to be achieved and reported on; and requiring subcontractors to be similarly bound. It also provides that if the objectives are not achieved, the customer can terminate or offset the supplier’s carbon emissions at the supplier’s expense.
