	<h4>Coolerplate Clauses (Climate Aligned Boilerplate)</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">‘Coolerplate’ generic clauses for every contract: embedding climate issues and net zero targets in the entire contract so that these flow into contract management and the commercial lifecycle. To focus parties on considering the climate emergency in their wider commercial conversations and to ensure that climate positive behaviours are cascaded throughout their contractual documents, from recitals to execution.</p>
