Child's Name: Eddie's Recitals
Long Name: Climate Recitals
Excerpt: Recitals that confirm the intentions of the parties to perform the contract in a way that reduces their organisational greenhouse gas emissions and the emissions associated with the contract. These recitals make climate a key consideration for the contract parties. While non-binding, recitals that expressly refer to climate raise the prominence of climate in the contractual relationship and signal the importance of climate to the parties when performing the contract.
