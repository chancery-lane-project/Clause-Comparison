Child's Name: Hanley's Clause
Long Name: Climate Change Clauses for Heads of Terms
Excerpt: Standard drafting for heads of terms that makes climate a key consideration for any deal team. These heads of terms are particularly relevant for parties with public decarbonisation or net-zero targets. Including climate in heads of terms raises the prominence and importance of climate at the outset of a commercial relationship. It allows the parties to design their relationship and frame their commercial dealings in ways that drive decarbonisation and help each party meet their organisational decarbonisation goals.
