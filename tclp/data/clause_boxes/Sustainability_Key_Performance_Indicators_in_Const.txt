	<h4>Sustainability Key Performance Indicators in Construction Works Task Orders</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">This clause sets assessment criteria for sustainable practices in construction works task orders to drive improvement in environmental and sustainability performance during the contract term. Incentivises the contractor/ supply chain to embed climate change considerations within design, appraisal, and construction.Â  Existing legal and policy frameworks obligate compliance, rather than drive improved sustainable practice.</p>
