Child's Name: Daniel's Clause
Long Name: Sustainability Key Performance Indicators in Construction Works Task Orders
Excerpt: This clause sets assessment criteria for sustainable practices in construction works task orders to drive improvement in environmental and sustainability performance during the contract term. Incentivises the contractor/ supply chain to embed climate change considerations within design, appraisal, and construction.Â 
Existing legal and policy frameworks obligate compliance, rather than drive improved sustainable practice.
