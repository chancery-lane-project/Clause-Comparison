	<h4>Net Zero Land Promotion Agreement</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">Amendments to standard land promotion agreements and precedents aimed at balancing climate change and environmental issues against maximising financial returns for the landowner and promoter. Assists landowners to discuss environmental implications of a development with their promoter/ developer, satisfying their interest in responsible development and placing environmental issues front and centre in future land use. The promoter will be incentivised by a bonus linked to net zero obligations. The approach is consistent with UK targets on net zero and therefore less likely to be challenged.</p>
