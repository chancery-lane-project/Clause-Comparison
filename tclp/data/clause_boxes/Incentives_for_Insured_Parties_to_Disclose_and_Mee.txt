	<h4>Incentives for Insured Parties to Disclose and Meet GHG Emissions Targets</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">This clause adapts Connorâ€™s Clause to place additional disclosure obligations on the insured if it changes, meets or fails to meet its emissions reduction targets, linked to premium adjustments. This clause incentivises insureds to meet emissions reduction targets by actively transitioning their business operations to net zero, for example by engaging green suppliers and consuming renewable energy. The clause is aimed at insureds operating in high emissions industries and therefore could, if taken up, have a high impact in promoting faster emissions reduction.</p>
