	<h4>Climate-Related Knowledge Sharing Between Insurer and Insured</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">A clause designed to increase communication between insurers and insureds, put the topic of climate change on the agenda and promote sustainable practices in line with a net zero future. This easily implemented “soft push” will promote mitigation of climate change through knowledge sharing in a mutually acceptable forum. Prompting the policyholder to assess climate change risks and impacts may decrease risk profile and the likelihood of claims, with policyholders benefitting from a premium reduction and insurers more likely to secure a renewal.</p>
