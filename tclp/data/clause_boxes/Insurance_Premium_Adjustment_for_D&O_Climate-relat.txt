Child's Name: Archie's Clause
Long Name: Insurance Premium Adjustment for D&O Climate-related Financial Disclosures
Excerpt: This clause incentivises companies to mitigate climate risk through a reduction in insurance premiums for policyholders who meet agreed disclosure standards regarding climate-related financial risks. In addition to the premium reduction, this will assist directors to mitigate climate risks and impacts, comply with directorsâ€™ duties and promote resilience. Alignment with the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) will enable familiarity with that framework ahead of legal requirements. Insurers will benefit from a reduction in claims and information on Policyholder risks, allowing for better pricing.
