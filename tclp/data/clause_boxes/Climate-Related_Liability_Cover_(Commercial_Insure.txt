	<h4>Climate-Related Liability Cover (Commercial Insureds)</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">This clause provides cover for climate-related injury and/or property damage in commercial insurance policies. Fills a gap in the UK insurance market, where there is currently no specific insurance cover for climate-related liability property damage or personal injury claims - i.e. climate-related injury or property damage caused/ contributed to by the policyholder's business.</p>
