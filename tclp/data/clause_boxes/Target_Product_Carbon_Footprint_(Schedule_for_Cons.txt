	<h4>Target Product Carbon Footprint (Schedule for Consumer Goods Contracts)</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">A Target Product Carbon Footprint budget (which reduces over time) for each product manufactured and supplied pursuant to the contract. Enables reduction of Scope 3 emissions from the supply chain by incentivising parties to meet emissions targets through a selection of alternative payment adjustments, to be tailored to requirements. While the continuous emissions reduction is consistent with a 1.5℃ pathway the parties may temporarily pause the reductions if they are unable to meet this pace.</p>
