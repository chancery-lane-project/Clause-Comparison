Child's Name: Jack Hiraya’s Clause
Long Name: Climate Lobbying and Responsible Investments: Policy Requirements
Excerpt: Obligations that can be included in any corporate investment, finance, insurance or supply agreement, requiring counterparties to demonstrate responsible climate policy engagement and leadership. This clause prevents a counterparty (Party B) from engaging in activities that jeopardise Party A’s net zero goals, its Paris Agreement aligned business strategies or pose reputational risk to Party A.  
There is a clear business case for responsible climate engagement. A party that has set a net zero target and aligned its business strategy with the goals of the Paris Agreement can ensure that counterparties are similarly aligned.
