	<h4>Conservation Covenant for Soil Preservation and Enhancement</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">A conservation covenant between a landowner or leaseholder and a ‘Responsible Body’ to secure the long-term preservation and enhancement of soil on privately owned, non-agricultural land. UK soils store over 10 billion tonnes of carbon in the form of organic matter, which equates to around 80 years of annual GHG emissions. Preventing emissions from soil and preserving and enhancing existing stores of soil carbon will help to meet the UK’s emission reduction targets.  Soil management is also significant in the context of increasingly extreme weather events predicted to result from climate change in the UK, including defence against flood and drought. In addition, the covenant facilitates Scope 3 emissions reductions by prohibiting the use of chemical fertilisers, intensive agricultural practices and associated land-use change, including deforestation.</p>
