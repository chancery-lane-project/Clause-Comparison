Long Name: Supply Chain Emissions Scorecard
Excerpt: A pro forma scorecard to be incorporated into commercial agreements as a schedule, allowing supply chain sustainability to be viewed through the lens of risk to business continuity. Positions sustainability performance as a collaborative effort between the parties, increases the transparency of a supplierâ€™s climate action through a robust reporting framework and gives contracting parties the opportunity to precisely quantify where they are in meeting their sustainability requirements.
