Child's Name: Kitty's Clause
Long Name: General Condition to Commercial Insurance Policies: Climate Change Risk Assessment
Excerpt: A clause requiring companies to carry out a climate change risk assessment, to be inserted into the General Conditions of corporate insurance policies across all lines of business. This clause prompts corporate policyholders and insurers to assess the climate-related risks posed to a policyholderâ€™s business. In doing so, it brings climate-related risks to businesses to the fore for corporate policyholders and their insurers which in turn builds sector familiarity (in identifying and managing climate-related risks), refines market understanding and influences market behavioural norms in relation to managing and mitigating climate-related risks.
