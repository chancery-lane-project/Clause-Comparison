	<p class="excerpt">A clause focusing on activation of sponsor rights relating to net zero to incentivise change, including a ‘reverse win bonus’ for the Sponsor if they hit their net zero target sooner. High profile sponsored parties can use this clause to ensure that their image is associated with ambitious action towards net zero, using the influence to drive positive change, whilst still being paid. The sponsor will receive additional promotional rights and incentives in relation to net zero and avoid reputational damage.</p>
