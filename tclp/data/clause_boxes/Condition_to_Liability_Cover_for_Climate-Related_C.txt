	<h4>Condition to Liability Cover for Climate-Related Claims (Commercial Insureds)</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">A condition to insurance cover requiring the insured to put in place a robust net zero transition plan prior to the inception of cover for climate-related liability claims. This clause requires a commercial policyholder to have a robust net zero transition plan in place (including emissions reductions targets) at the inception of an insurance policy, before it can access insurance liability cover for climate-related claims. This will drive good behaviour, put the insured on a path to net zero and reduce the risk of climate-related claims being made against the insured, ensuring that the insurerâ€™s business is sustainable.</p>
