Child's Name: Connor's Clause
Long Name: Condition to Liability Cover for Climate-Related Claims (Commercial Insureds)
Excerpt: A condition to insurance cover requiring the insured to put in place a robust net zero transition plan prior to the inception of cover for climate-related liability claims. This clause requires a commercial policyholder to have a robust net zero transition plan in place (including emissions reductions targets) at the inception of an insurance policy, before it can access insurance liability cover for climate-related claims. This will drive good behaviour, put the insured on a path to net zero and reduce the risk of climate-related claims being made against the insured, ensuring that the insurerâ€™s business is sustainable.
