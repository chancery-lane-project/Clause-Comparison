Child's Name: Madhavi's Clause
Long Name: Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) and Net Zero Provisions for Construction or Development Agreements
Excerpt: Adapts sustainable practices and net zero aligned provisions from TCLPâ€™s construction clauses for use in MMC contracts. Allows contracting parties to embed their vision of sustainability through the use of MMC into contracts, while also achieving the cost and efficiency benefits MMC offers. The clause is practical and considerate of the realities of off-site construction and promotes MMC use in a sustainable way by parties to construction contracts or development agreements.
