	<h4>Green Loan “Starter Pack”</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">Green loan clauses that are aligned to the Green Loan Principles (as defined below) by reference to Loan Market Association (LMA) style drafting. Market standard wording to make finance accessible to borrowers unfamiliar with green loans, increasing the financing of eligible green projects. Designed as a base to be tailored in commercial and legal negotiations, it is widely applicable rather than transaction specific. Lenders will benefit from a clear monitoring framework to prevent greenwashing.</p>
