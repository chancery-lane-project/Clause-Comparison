	<h4>Climate Contract Risk Sharing (ex Force Majeure)</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">Amendments and additions to standard Force Majeure agreements to ensure contracting parties work together to balance financial risks and avoid unintended adverse environmental and social issues. This clause enables parties to work together in good faith to take control of contractual climate risk and plan to mitigate negative climate and social impacts arising from adverse events whilst looking after commercial needs. This creates an orderly transition to a new normal based on balancing financial obligations and environmental and social impact.</p>
