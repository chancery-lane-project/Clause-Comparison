Child's Name: Noah's Clause
Long Name: Green or Sustainability-Linked Lending Requirement
Excerpt: Rider clauses (for LMA facilities agreements) that require each Lender to confirm that a percentage of its lending is sustainable or 'green' finance. This clause ensures that Lenders are aligned with the Borrower’s net zero values and promotes greater transparency within the banking sector.  
Borrowers should set sustainability-linked lending thresholds for Lenders to meet to: (i) participate in the loan; and (ii) receive the full Margin payment (or other pre-selected consequences).
