	<h4>Employer-Employee Environmental Obligations</h4>
	<p class="excerpt">This clause repurposes employee leave periods as opportunities to volunteer with environmental organisations by integrating climate-conscious employer-employee obligations into employment contracts. This clause enables employees on garden leave or sabbaticals to use the time to volunteer at an environmental organisation, subsidising the workforce for tackling climate change issues. Companies can incentivise their employees and contribute towards the transition to net zero through employee time that might otherwise not be so well used.</p>
