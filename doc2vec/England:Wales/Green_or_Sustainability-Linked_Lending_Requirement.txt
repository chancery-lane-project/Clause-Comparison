(i) automatically extended until the Termination Date that applies to Facility B; and
(ii) treated as separate Facility B Loans (the 
Separate Loans

On receipt of that notice, the Agent will forward a copy to the Defaulting Lender as soon as practicable. [The proportion of the prepayment of the Separate Loan to the amount of the Separate Loans must not exceed the proportion of the prepayment of the Facility B Utilisation to the Facility B Utilisations.]
(e) Interest on a Separate Loan accrues for successive Interest Periods. These Interest Periods are selected by the Borrower by a time and date specified by the Agent, acting reasonably. The interest must be paid by [that Company/ Borrower] to the Agent (for the account of that Defaulting Lender) on the last day of each Interest Period of that Loan.
(f) The terms of this Agreement relating to Facility B Loans apply to Separate Loans. Where those terms are inconsistent with paragraphs (c) to (e) above, those paragraphs shall prevail in respect of a Separate Loan.] [

25.1 By countersigning this Agreement, an Original Lender confirms that it complied with the Environmental Lender Requirement at the last day of the most recent financial year (an 
Environmental Lending Confirmation)
.* Each year, an Original Lender must confirm in writing that it meets the Environmental Lender Requirement within [twenty (20)] Business Days of the anniversary of that signature (
Environmental Confirmation Date
).
* [
Drafting note: the requirement to report annually raises the ambition of this Clause and should align with the timing of existing reporting requirements. However, if the Lender deems annual confirmation to be too onerous, an alternative would be the right for the borrower to request the Lender to confirm compliance and the obligation for the Lender to deliver an Environmental Lending Confirmation within a set time period of such request (such request not to be exercised more than once a year).
]
25.2 If a Lender stops meeting the Environmental Lender Requirement it must notify the Agent within [twenty (20)] Business Days of the end of that Lender’s most recent financial year. The Agent shall promptly notify the Company of that notice.
25.3 If a Lender:
(a) notifies the Agent that it does not meet the Environmental Lender Requirement in accordance with Clause 25.2; or
(b) is unable or does not provide an Environmental Lending Confirmation [within [ten (10)] Business Days of/ by] the Environmental Confirmation Date under Clause 25.1,
[either:]*
(i) [it is a Defaulting Lender under this Agreement [(the 
Default Option
)][; or] [
Drafting note: only use the defined term Default Option if retaining both options in this Clause 25.3
]
(ii) [the Margin applying to that Lender’s Commitments is reduced by [0.25]% (the 
ESG Margin Reduction
) and the Borrower shall donate an amount equal to the ESG Margin Reduction to an Environmental Charity [(the 
Margin Option
)]. This payment will be made on each Interest Payment Date.] [
Drafting note: only use the defined term Margin Option if retaining both options in this Clause 25.3
]
* [
Drafting note: clause users should decide whether both options should be open to the borrower as a remedy for default or whether to select only one remedy to be applicable, and should edit the square bracketed options as relevant.
]
25.4 Before the Environmental Confirmation Date, a Lender can request more time to provide the Environmental Lending Confirmation. Upon such request, the Environmental Confirmation Date is automatically extended for [twenty (20)] Business Days (an 
Environmental Lending Confirmation Extension
). If the Lender is unable or does not provide an Environmental Lending Confirmation by the end of that extension, [it is a Defaulting Lender under this Agreement] [or] [the ESG Margin Reduction applies] in accordance with Clause 25.3.
[25.5 The [Borrower] must notify the Lender within [●] days whether it will apply the Default Option or the Margin Option where the Lender does not meet the Environmental Lender Requirement.] [

The Margin Option
26.1 The ESG Margin Reduction:
(a) takes effect from the first Business Day after the earlier of:
(i) the Lender’s notice under Clause 25.2 that it does not meet the Environmental Lender Requirement; or
(ii) the Environmental Confirmation Date where the Lender has not provided an Environmental Lending Confirmation under Clause 25.3; or
(iii) the last day of the Environmental Lending Confirmation Extension under Clause 25.5,
and

[35.4 Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders
(a) A Defaulting Lender’s Commitments and participation under the relevant [Facility/ Facilities] will be deemed to be zero, when deciding:
(i) the Majority Lenders; or
(ii) whether agreement has been obtained under the Finance Documents for approval of a request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of the Lenders, from:
(A) any percentage of the Total Commitments or Total Facility B Commitments; or 
(B) the agreement of any specified group of Lenders.
(b) For the purposes of this Clause 35.4, the Agent may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:
(i) any Lender which has notified the Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender; and
(ii) any Lender for which it is aware that any of the events or circumstances referred to in the definition of 'Defaulting Lender' has occurred,
(c) Clause 35.4(b) is subject to the Agent:
(i) receiving contrary notice from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Agent); or
(ii) being aware that the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.*]
