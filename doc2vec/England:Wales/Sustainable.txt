The concept of sustainable development was described by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report as 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'.
There are four dimensions to sustainable development â€“ society, environment, culture and economy. They are intertwined, not separate.
While the terms 'sustainable' and 'sustainability' are used in many agreements (including TCLP clauses), they are rarely defined in a commercial setting. This glossary term proposes a benchmark definition that can then be tweaked to suit each specific contract.

Sustainable
 means activities that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes the conservation of finite resources.
