A system of carbon budgets (or interim emissions reduction targets) is a useful tool for organisations to manage and reduce their carbon footprint and achieve their emissions reduction targets.
Measuring emissions
Emissions are measured in carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2e or CO2eq ), which compares the global warming potential ( GWP ) of various greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) to that of carbon dioxide. The most up-to-date GWP values can be found at Table 7.SM.7, page 1842 of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.
Independent verification
The definition suggests that the final value should be calculated by an independent expert, and the parties should consider what experience or qualification this expert should have and how any disagreements over the expert’s findings should be resolved.
Define the term 'independent expert' to remove uncertainty.
