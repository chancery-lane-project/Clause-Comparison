Offshoring describes geographically relocating a company's high greenhouse gas emitting activities to another country. Importing goods and services is a form of emissions offshoring.
Emissions offshoring could be used to make it appear that a company has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. Where companies are measuring their 
Scope 3 Emissions
, these must cover any offshored emissions.
Studies show that when firms increase their imports, their own emissions fall with a corresponding rise in supplier generated emissions.
This definition is deliberately broad so it can be easily adjusted to fit a variety of contracts and contexts.
