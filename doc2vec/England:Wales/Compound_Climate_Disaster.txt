Extreme weather events are defined as weather that is unseasonal, unexpected, unusual or severe in comparison to historical weather distribution for a particular area.
In climate science, compound events can be:
Two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively;
Combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact of the events; or
Combinations of events that are not themselves extremes but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined.
For a party (for example, an insured policyholder) to be affected by a compound climate disaster, they (or relevant aspects of their business) must be situated within the exact location that the extreme weather event(s) occurred.
