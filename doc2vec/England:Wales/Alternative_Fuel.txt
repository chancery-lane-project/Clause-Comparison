This definition derives from that in the 
Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive 2014 (2014/94/EU).
The definition captures fuels, even those derived from fossil fuels, that have a lower term greenhouse gas intensity than conventional fossil fuels and that may be used to decarbonise the transport sector in the transition to net zero.
The classification of alternative fuels is a technical area. For more information on EU and UK legislation in this area, see:
Practical Law, Regulation of vehicle emissions in England and Wales: summary
; and
LexisNexis, Alternative vehicle fuels - natural gas (liquefied natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG))
.

Alternative Fuel
 means fuel or power sources used as a substitute for fossil oil sources in transport. They have the potential to help to decarbonise the transport sector and enhance its 
Environmental Performance
 and include:
(a) electricity;
(b) hydrogen;
(c) liquid or gaseous biofuels derived from biomass;
(d) synthetic and paraffinic fuels;
(e) natural gas, including biomethane in gaseous form (compressed natural gas) and liquefied form (liquefied natural gas ( LNG )); and
(f) liquefied petroleum gas.
