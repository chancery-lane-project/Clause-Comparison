An emissions statement can be used in any transaction involving emissions reduction targets. The statement will state the company's GHG emissions at a specific point in time (for example, at a specific year or at completion). This will then be compared against a carbon budget or other emissions reduction target.
If the GHG emissions are higher or lower than the target, then the contract can provide incentives or penalties, such as discounts or fees.
