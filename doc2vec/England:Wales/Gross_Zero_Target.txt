Net Zero v Gross Zero
Most countries, cities, companies and other entities are setting net zero targets rather than gross zero targets. This is because net zero targets allow both:
a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
offsetting any emissions that cannot be reduced.
Option 1
The words 'all sources' refer to 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions.
 If you intend that the definition refers to only one or two of these categories of emissions, you will need to amend the reference to 'all sources'.

Gross Zero Target
 means the reduction of all of [the Company's] greenhouse gas emissions from all sources to zero by [
specified date
].
﻿

Gross Zero Target
 means an absolute reduction in 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
from all operations [including its value chain] to zero by [
a specified date
] and for each subsequent year thereafter.
