Sufficient budget and resources
Measuring environmental performance is not a tick-box exercise and available budget and resources need to be considered when choosing the method of measurement. A relevant question is whether any financing needs to include the costs of such assessments.
Independent verification
This defined term should be used with an operative provision that mandates the appointment of an independent expert who will determine whether the relevant party or company has met the key performance indicators. In particular, the provision should describe with how the independent expert is appointed, who pays for their services and how disagreements between the parties about the expert's appointment or findings will be dealt with.
An operative provision might look like this:
The Company’s performance against the [Net Zero OR Environmental] Performance key performance indicators will be measured [quarterly] by the Independent Expert appointed by the Parties in accordance with clause [●]. The Independent Expert will issue a report on the Company’s performance against the [Net Zero OR Environmental] Performance Targets to the Board [within 30 (thirty) calendar days of] each quarter.
Option 1
This option provides a menu of key performance factors that could be used to measure the company's success in achieving all of the following:
its organisational net zero target (and interim net zero targets)
emissions reductions targets set by the contract which either or both parties are obliged to deliver on during the contract term
other environmental targets
This definition also provides some ideas for specific environmental standards and guidelines against which the key performance indicators can be set. The parties can replace these with other standards and guidelines that they are working towards. If the parties wish to determine their own metrics, these could be set out in a schedule. In this case, the metrics should be quantitative where possible and the schedule should clearly set out how they are to be calculated.
Option 2
This definition measures the environmental impact of a premises or building over its entire lifecycle. The aim is to achieve a net zero and environmental key performance indicators across the whole of the premises or building’s life - from the manufacture, use and disposal of the premises or building.
As with option 1, lawyers can tailor the menu appropriate to their contract or client.
