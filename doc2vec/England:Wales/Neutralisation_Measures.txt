Neutralisation measures refer to the removal and permanent storage of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. An example of a neutralisation measure is the use of 
Carbon Capture and Storage
 technology.
Mitigation Hierarchy
 A company's decarbonisation strategy must take into account the mitigation hierarchy. Its first priority is to implement measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Neutralisation measures should be implemented only after a company has made all reasonable efforts to reduce its emissions. See also the EU's 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Directive (2009/31/EC)
, which states that the development of CCS technology should not lead to a reduction of efforts to support energy saving policies and renewable energy.
Like for Like
 In implementing neutralisation measures, companies should consider whether the measure is appropriate for the source of their emissions (e.g. fossil or biological). For more information, see 
Fossil and biological carbon: a tonne is not a tonne
.
Permanence
 The length of time greenhouse gases should be stored is still the subject of debate. Technologies to permanently store greenhouse gas emissions are still under development.
Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
 Under the SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard, neutralisation measures should only be implemented after a company has achieved its long-term science-based target. A company's long-term science-based target should be to reduce at least 90 percent of a company's 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions
 by no later than 2050.
