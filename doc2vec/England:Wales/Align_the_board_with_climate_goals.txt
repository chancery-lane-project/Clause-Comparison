align their corporate strategy and 
transition plan






incentivise board members to achieve their emissions-reduction targets






mitigate reputational and liability risks, especially 
greenwashing

greenhouse gas emissions
.








Align directors’ duties with climate targets






Use governance documents to make directors accountable for reducing the company’s emissions and achieving other climate goals.






Write directors’ responsibilities into, for example, company policies or articles of association. This incentivises directors to align the business with 
Paris Agreement goals
, especially if they risk personal liability for failing to comply.
