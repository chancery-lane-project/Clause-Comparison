Setting a carbon neutral date
A carbon neutral date can be set voluntarily by any organisation that wants to show its climate change ambitions. Alternatively, the organisation might be compelled to set a carbon neutral date by its investors if it has not already done so voluntarily.
Relevant considerations
Whether carbon neutrality is possible will depend on jurisdiction and the organisation's access to carbon offsetting mechanisms and renewable energy, amongst other factors.
Just transition
Carbon neutrality may be too ambitious in some jurisdictions. Lawyers using this definition might want to consider alternative actions that would have a positive impact (or less of a negative impact), such as the protection of carbon sinks.
