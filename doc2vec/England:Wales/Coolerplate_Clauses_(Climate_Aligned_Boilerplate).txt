Nico's Clause

insert relevant desired climate outcomes
]; and 
(b) it gives prior written notice of the subcontract or delegation to the other party.
1.5 Waiver
The parties’ rights and remedies under this Agreement or law shall not be waived, precluded or restricted by a party’s failure or delay in exercising them if the principal reason for the failure or delay was to prevent an Adverse Climate Outcome. 
[
Drafting note: the word ‘if’ makes the waiver a ‘dark green’ clause. This is because the parties only benefit from waiver protection if the delay or failure to exercise their rights and remedies is because they were trying to prevent an Adverse Climate Outcome. No other reason for delay or failure will grant waiver protection. This is an acknowledged departure from standard waiver clauses.
