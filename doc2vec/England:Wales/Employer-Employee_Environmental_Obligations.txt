Eric's Clause
This clause repurposes employee leave periods as opportunities to volunteer with environmental organisations by integrating climate-conscious employer-employee obligations into employment contracts.
Senior Employment Contract 
1. Interpretation
The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement.
Appointment
 means your employment by us on the terms of [this agreement/ the employment contract between you and us dated [●]].
Environmental Voluntary Work
 means voluntary work [with an environmental organisation*] that helps tackle the climate crisis, including by promoting: 
(a) biodiversity;
(b) adaptation to climate change;
(c) resilience to climate change;
(d) a circular economy; [and/or]
(e) a just transition to a low carbon economy[; and/or
(f) 
insert another climate positive outcome of the voluntary work
]. 
* [
Drafting note: The clause might not need to restrict environmental voluntary work to work done for environmental organisations only. If the employee does voluntary work that has a positive impact on tackling the climate crisis, the employer may be happy for the employee to do that work for an organisation other than an environmental organisation.
