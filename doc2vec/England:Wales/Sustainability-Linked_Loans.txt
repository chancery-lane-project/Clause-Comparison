Casper's Clause
Model clauses, as a set of optional riders divided into product categories and ESG goals, to incorporate SLPs into traditional financing documents, standard T&Cs and finance products. 
[
Drafting note: Using this clause in LMA form documents: While Casper’s Clause can be used in recommended form documents published by the LMA, it has not been endorsed by, or produced in conjunction with, the LMA. Using and reproducing LMA documents generally are subject to certain restrictions, specifically they may only be used by LMA members for preparing and documenting agreements relating to transactions or potential transactions in the loan markets.

[Drafting note: Capitalised terms relate to either a defined term in this clause or a defined term in the main agreement that this clause is designed to be inserted into.]
1.
 
Sustainability-Linked Facilities
1.1 [Facility/ Tranche] [●] and [Facility/ Tranche] [●] are each designated as a Sustainability-Linked Facility.
1.2 Sustainability Performance Targets 
Each Sustainability-Linked Borrower undertakes to use [its best]/ [all reasonable] endeavours to achieve its SPTs.
1.3 Sustainability Performance Evaluations
1.3.1 Within [15] Business Days of receiving a Sustainability Compliance Certificate under Clause 3.1.1 (Sustainability Compliance Certificate), the Sustainability Coordinator shall provide the Sustainability-Linked Borrower with a Sustainability Performance Evaluation detailing the SPTs that are Achieved SPTs for the purposes of calculating a Sustainability-Linked Margin Decrease or Sustainability-Linked Margin Increase under Clause 1.3.2 below.
1.3.2 Each Sustainability Performance Evaluation shall determine whether a Sustainability-Linked Margin Decrease or a Sustainability-Linked Margin Increase shall apply for the Relevant Period, using the following calculations:
(a) if the number of Achieved SPTs is over [75%] of the total number of SPTs as at the most recent Sustainability Performance Test Date then the Sustainability-Linked Margin Decrease shall apply; or
(b) if the number of Achieved SPTs is under [50%] of the total number of SPTs as at the most recent Sustainability Performance Test Date then the Sustainability-Linked Margin Increase shall apply.
[
Drafting note: Users of this clause may wish to tailor this drafting to the lenders’ requirements and borrower’s circumstances by weighting the targets that are the most critical. Rather than specifying a percentage of the total SPTs should be achieved, the Sustainability Performance Evaluation could be assessed on a failure to achieve specific SPTs.
]
2.
 
Representations
[
Insert sustainability-linked representations and warranties – for example, correct form of reporting on SPTs etc.
]
3.
 
Information Undertakings
3.1 Sustainability Compliance Certificate
3.1.1 Within 30 days of each Sustainability Performance Test Date, each Sustainability-Linked Borrower shall supply the Sustainability Coordinator with a Sustainability Compliance Certificate setting out (in form and substance satisfactory to the Sustainability Coordinator, acting reasonably) information that complies with this Clause 3.1.
3.1.2 Each Sustainability Compliance Certificate shall:
(a) report on the Sustainability-Linked Borrower’s performance against each SPT as at the relevant Sustainability Performance Test Date, and identify the Achieved SPTs;
(b) include any relevant report, certification, rating or any other information required by any SPT;
(c) detail any assumptions used by the Sustainability-Linked Borrower to prepare the Sustainability Compliance Certificate and evidence of the Sustainability-Linked Borrower’s compliance with each SPT; 
(d) attach a Verification Report signed by the Sustainability Expert;
(e) be reviewed by the Sustainability Committee and signed by a director of the Sustainability-Linked Borrower; and
(f) report on any failure by the Sustainability-Linked Borrower to comply with its Sustainability Objectives.
3.2 Sustainability Strategy
Each Sustainability-Linked Borrower shall:
(a) at all times and in all material respects procure that the Group’s business is carried out in accordance with the Sustainability Strategy; and
(b) only amend or vary the Sustainability Strategy with the prior written consent of the Sustainability Coordinator (acting in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
4.
 
[Events of Default]/ [Sustainability-Linked Margin Increase]/ [Declassification]
[
Drafting note: The parties may not wish for a breach of the sustainability provisions to be an Event of Default, as it may disincentivise the Sustainability-Linked Borrower from agreeing to more ambitious SPTs. Instead, the parties may agree that (i) a margin increase shall apply or (ii) if the Borrower fails to comply with these provisions, the loan will be "declassified" and can no longer be classified as a sustainability-linked loan. The economic benefits of the sustainability link (i.e. the reduction in margin) will no longer be available to the Borrower and the Borrower will not be able to publicise the loan as sustainability-linked. The parties may wish to include additional events here, i.e. a change in the status or business of the Borrower.
]
[An Event of Default]/ [A Sustainability-Linked Margin Increase]/ A Declassification Event] shall occur if:
4.1 The Sustainability-Linked Borrower:
4.1.1 fails to provide a Sustainability Compliance Certificate for a Sustainability Performance Evaluation within 30 days of each Sustainability Performance Test Date under clause 3.1.1; and
4.1.2 does not remedy the failure in clause 4.1.1 within [15] Business Days. For the avoidance of doubt, the [15] Business Days start from the end of the 30 days in clause 3.1.1; or
4.2 [a Sustainability-Linked Borrower fails to remedy a [material] breach reported under Clause 3.1.2(e) within [60] days of a written request by the Sustainability Coordinator (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders).]
5.
 
Rendezvous
[5.1 If a Sustainability-Linked Borrower or the Sustainability Coordinator (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) determines that the SPTs cannot be calculated or are no longer fit for purpose, a Sustainability-Linked Borrower and the Sustainability Coordinator (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) shall negotiate in good faith for a period of not more than [60] days to agree revised SPTs.
5.2 If revised SPTs cannot be agreed by a Sustainability-Linked Borrower and the Sustainability Coordinator (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) in accordance with Clause 6.1, a Declassification Event shall occur.]
[
Drafting note: The parties may wish to include mechanics such that if the SPTs are not met, the parties can agree to (i) enter into negotiations to revisit the SPTs, or (ii) declassify the loan as a sustainability-linked loan.
