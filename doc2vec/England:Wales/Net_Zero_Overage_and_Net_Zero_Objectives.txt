2

An overage clause is generally included in a commercial property or land sale contract by the seller so that the seller is entitled to receive additional funds post-completion if a ‘trigger event’ takes place.
In this case, the trigger event is the buyer’s failure to meet the net zero objectives (as defined) post-completion.
Rory’s Clause (Net Zero Land Promotion Agreement)
 uses this definition to do both of the following:
discourage buyers from failing to meet the net zero objectives set in the sale agreement
allow landowners to influence the climate impact of a development.
Option 2
If using this definition, consider which of the net zero objectives need to be included in your agreement and tailor the menu accordingly.
